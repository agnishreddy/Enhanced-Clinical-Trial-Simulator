# Clinical Trial Simulator

## Overview
The **Clinical Trial Simulator** is an interactive R Shiny application designed to simulate, analyze, and optimize clinical trial designs. It provides a user-friendly interface to test various trial parameters and visualize outcomes, making it ideal for researchers, educators, and healthcare professionals.

---

## Features
- **Trial Simulation**: 
  Generate random datasets with adjustable parameters such as sample size, treatment effect size, and significance level.
- **Advanced Visualization**: 
  View group comparisons using violin plots, boxplots, and jittered points.
- **Power Analysis**: 
  Assess statistical power across varying effect sizes to ensure robust trial designs.
- **Data Export**: 
  Download simulated datasets for further analysis or collaboration.
- **Educational Support**: 
  Built-in help section to understand statistical concepts like p-values, confidence intervals, and power.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/clinical-trial-simulator.git
   ```
2. Install the required R packages:
   ```R
   install.packages(c("shiny", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "magrittr"))
   ```
3. Run the Shiny app:
   ```R
   shiny::runApp("path_to_your_app_folder")
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the app and input the trial parameters (e.g., sample size, effect size, standard deviation).
2. Click **Run Simulation** to generate data and view results:
   - **P-value**
   - **Confidence intervals**
   - **Mean difference**
3. Access the **Power Analysis** tab to evaluate statistical power across varying effect sizes.
4. Use the **Download Data** button to export the simulated dataset.
